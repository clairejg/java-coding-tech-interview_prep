If we want to pass the list as a parameter, all we have to pass is a reference to the first node. For example, the method printList takes a single node as an argument. Starting with the head of the list, it prints each node until it gets to the end (indicated by the null reference).

    public static void printList (Node list) {
        Node node = list;

        while (node != null) {
            System.out.print (node);
            node = node.next;
        }
        System.out.println ();
    }
